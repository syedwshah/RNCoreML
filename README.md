# RNCoreML

To use all the features you will most likely need to run this on a physical device.

If you need help running on a physical device, please refer to
https://reactnative.dev/docs/running-on-device

Simply clone the repo, and from the root project directory run:

```
yarn
```

```
npx pod-install
```

Open up RNCoreMLApp.xcworkspace and build the project.

When the app runs, you need to allow access to your camera (and network on the fully completed RNCoreML).
If you don't allow access, then you may have to change permissions from your phone's settings. Otherwise you would need to delete the app on your phone, and rebuild the project.

And that's pretty much it!
